Hey, I’m Nate Weber, also known as @WorldWideWeb-er

I recently graduated from the University of Northern Iowa and have been teaching myself a good majority of front end web development with the help of classes from Des Moines Iowa's local community college.

My main focuses when working with front end web applications are user experience and user interface, keeping a site neat, tidy, and running smoothly are my top priorities.
